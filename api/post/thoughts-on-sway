{"metadata":{"title":"Thoughts on Sway","author":"Ethan Zhang","description":"Some thoughts on the Sway window manager","date":"07/09/2023","id":2},"content":"<p><img src=\"/thoughts-on-sway-blogpost.png\" alt=\"swaywm\"></p>\n<p>I got my first introduction to tiling window managers with <code>sway</code> in the summer of 2021.\nAfter around a month, however, I decided that <code>Wayland</code> wasn't quite ready for my use, and I ultimately switched to <code>i3</code>\non <code>X11</code>.\nAlthough I like the auto-tiling windows and keyboard-driven workflow, I <em>really</em> didn't want to be having any\nissues with screen-sharing, audio, or Electron/Chromium-based apps right at the height of the pandemic.\nPlus, it would only start on my laptop, as my desktop's Nvidia card wasn't supported (Nvidia had their own way of\nimplementing <code>Wayland</code> support which was different from how literally every other vendor did it).</p>\n<p>Over the next two years, I hopped back and forth between different a couple of different window\nmanagers: first <code>dwm</code>, which I left due to issues from it not being <code>ewmh</code> compliant (e.g. fullscreen\nwindows and some other things I can't quite recall); then <code>xmonad</code>, which, although I still like, can sometimes be a\nbit tough to configure (<em>especially</em> <code>xmobar</code>, which I could never quite figure out); <code>qtile</code>, which eased up all my\nconfigurations woes with the caveat of draining my laptop's battery; and <code>bspwm</code>, which I honestly don't have many\ncomplaints about (every tiling window manager should have something like <code>bspc</code>).</p>\n<p>But after quite a few mishaps with output configuration at school, I decided about a week and a half ago (June 30th) to\ngive <code>sway</code> and <code>Wayland</code> another try.</p>\n<h2>The Good</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Outputs work flawlessly (monitors with different resolutions or refresh rates, fractional scaling, hot-plugging,\netc.)--no need to fiddle with <code>xrandr</code> anymore!</li>\n<li>No screen-tearing!</li>\n<li>Configuring my mouse and keyboard was super easy--I don't need to search for <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf</code>\nor whichever file it was again!</li>\n<li>Screen-sharing now works in most apps.</li>\n<li>Nvidia also now mostly works.</li>\n<li><code>swaymsg</code> (and, by extension, <code>sway-ipc</code>) is wonderful.</li>\n<li><code>sway</code> is a lot more \"all-in-one\" than most other window managers (wallpapers, idle configuration, etc.)</li>\n<li><code>Wayland</code> is \"more secure\" than <code>X11</code>--although this is true, I don't know how important it actually is for my use\ncase.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Bad</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I still have issues with Electron/Chromium-based apps.</li>\n<li><code>XWayland</code> is kinda jank, but too many pieces of software don't yet run natively on <code>Wayland</code>.</li>\n<li><code>Wine</code> is also still jank.</li>\n<li>No global keybinds (goodbye push-to-talk).</li>\n<li><code>sway</code> doesn't have too many cool compositing effects--there's transparency, but that's it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>If I had to pick my \"top-three window managers,\" <code>sway</code> would definitely be up there (along with <code>xmonad</code> and <code>bspwm</code>).\nI'd recommend it to anyone new to tiling window managers, as it strikes a good balance between being\nextensible and easily customizable.\nAdditionally, although there are some hiccups, <code>Wayland</code>'s been making a lot of progress recently, and I'm confident\nthey'll all be ironed out soon enough.</p>"}
