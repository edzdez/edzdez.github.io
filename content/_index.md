Hi!
I'm Ethan Zhang, a second-year undergrad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying mathematics and computer science.
I'm primarily interested in theoretical computer science and its applications to mathematics,
with a particular emphasis on proof assistants, logic, and type theory.
Outside of that, I enjoy fiddling around with Linux, functional programming, coffee, and fountain pens.
