Hi!
I'm Ethan, a third-year undergrad at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm studying mathematics and computer science.
On the math side, I'm particularly interested in algebra, set theory, and topology.
In computer science, my focus is primarily in programming languages and logic;
in particular, I hope to explore how computer science can be applied to the study of mathematics, e.g. through proof assistants.
Outside of academics, my hobbies include Linux, coffee, and fountain pens.

TODO:

Add a blurb about previous experience, e.g.
  - 3 sems as a CS 173 CA,
  - Deere, and
  - Google.

Perhaps also add a chunk like
``This semester, I'm doing a reading course with Prof. Mattox Beckman on Type/Proof/Category Theory,''
and also talk about being an ACM SIGPLAN lead.

Then, maybe add a section on ``Talks'' and paste in SIGMA talk.
