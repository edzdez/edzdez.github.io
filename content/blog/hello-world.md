Welcome to my blog!

It supports writing `code`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
```

Quotes:

> Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better. 

And math ($\LaTeX$):

$$
\lim_{x \to c}{f(x)} = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0:
0 < |x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - L| < \epsilon
$$
